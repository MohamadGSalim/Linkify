# Linkify-390

This project is part of the SOEN 390 â€” Software Engineering Team Design Project coursework.

## Course Description

Throughout this course, we as a team got the chance to put the knowledge and skillset we've acquired over the course of our studies to work by applying them in a real-world setting. By creating a collaborative work environment where every team member participates in every stage of the software development cycle and by following the Agile methodology, we were able to keep up with the changing demands of a typical modern workplace. Furthermore, using project management tools to monitor team progress against our devised plan, effectively communicating as a team, and then refining the plan based on our observations has made a world of difference in terms of overall project success!

## Project Description

Linkify is an employment focused platform for hiring managers and recruiters to connect with potential candidates. provide students and other professionals the ability to connect with their peers, professors, and potential employers. Initially, users are asked to sign up, fill in their personal detials and select their account type (recruiter or candidate). In order for a public user to create their profile, every account must be associated with one email address. Once a user's account has been set up, they can invite others to join their network and invited users can either accept or reject the invitations they receive. Once an invitation has been accepted, conncted users can direct message and send one another a variety of different file types such as PDF, DOC, PPT and XLS. Most importantly, all DMs are moderated and reviewed to prevent potential illegal activities such as harrasment.
