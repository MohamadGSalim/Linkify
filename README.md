# Linkify-390
This is the repo for the mini-capstone (SOEN 390) Project Winter 2023

## Objective
 this project will allow students to apply their knowledge and skills in a real-world setting. It provides the opportunity to gain experience working on a team, developing a portfolio of work, and solving complex problems using the software development process. Additionally, students can learn new tools and technologies, improve their ability to communicate technical ideas to non-technical stakeholders, and build self-confidence in their capabilities to take on software engineering projects independently. The capstone project also provides students with an opportunity to present and defend their work to a panel of experts.

## Project Description

In this project the Linkify team is creating a new platform that provide students and other professionals the ability to connect with their peers, professors, and potential employers. By using this app, users will be able to:

Build and maintain a professional online presence
1- Network with classmates, alumni, and professionals in their field of interest
2- Discover job and internship opportunities
3- Learn about upcoming events and opportunities
4- Get recommendations and endorsements from peers and professors
5- Enhance their personal branding

the app aims to help students build valuable connections, acquire new skills, and prepare for the workforce.
